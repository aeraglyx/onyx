# Onyx

A minimalistic dark theme for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

You can get it from the [Extensions Platform](https://extensions.blender.org/themes/onyx/) or directly in Blender (Preferences > Get Extensions > Themes).

## Main Features

- Darker and more subdued than default.
- Neutral greys (good for color perception).
- Limited color palette for less clutter.
- Strong light blue accents where it counts.
- Red reserved for errors and such.

## Known Issues

- Unlike most Blender themes, active items in Onyx are dark on light. There are some places where this doesn't work very well, so a few compromises had to be made.
- I didn't check every single setting, namely the rigging side of things needs some testing.

Please report any issues and enjoy Onyx!
