# Onyx

A minimalistic dark theme for Blender.

![ScreenShot](/img/onyx_theme_example.png)

## Main Features

- Darker and more subdued than default.
- Neutral greys (good for color perception).
- Limited color palette for less clutter.
- Striking light blue accents where it counts.
- Mostly unified between editors.

## Known Issues

- Unlike most other themes, active items in Onyx are dark on light, which presents some challenges. Currently it can't be done properly, so a few compromises had to be made.
- I didn't check every single setting, namely the rigging side of things needs some testing.
